# Hella-Wurld
Hella-Wurld is a repositiory for practicing GitHub as part of my latest adventure with CodeYou!

In the Fall of 2019, I began my re-entry into the Wurld of Komputing with pre-work for the original Code Louisville program. Surprisingly, you CAN teach an old dawg gnu trix! Not only did I successfully complete the grueling pre-work while helping a family member recover from an undisclosed illness in the mountains surrounding Portland, OR, but I even passed my equally grueling Front End course. 

Following my successful tech career re-launch, I completed the full Code Louisville Web Development program with courses in Front End & Back End web development including coursework in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C#, Salesforce and maybe some other courses. I made great contacts and still keep up with some of my classmaties.

I'll certainly update this here README page when I figure out which path my journey will traverse.
